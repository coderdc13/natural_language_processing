Homework for Natural Language Processing (NLP)


The main text is in the NLP Companion because of the need to display data. Although the main text usually reserved for the README, the text is moved to a notebook for easier reading by the Instructor-Grader (IG). The student author (me, Franklin Bueno) apologizes for any inconvenience. In addition, it is important to note that although the named entity recognition (NER) graphics may not normally be seen through GitHub software, thanks to Instructor KS, these graphics may be seen through the links in the bootcampspot.com portal that include the general viewer at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and also the specific latest updated site. In addition, the graphics are provided (below).
